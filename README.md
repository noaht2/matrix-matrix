# Five ways to view matrix-matrix multiplication, but better
One of the [MLAB](https://redwoodresearch.org/mlab)v2 prerequistes is an article titled [Matrix-Matrix Multiplication](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/Matrix-Matrix_Multiplication) by the [ML Wiki](http://mlwiki.org) and *5 ways to view Matrix-Matrix Multiplication* on the Google doc of prerequisites.
Although the article probably communicates exactly the material MLAB thinks its attendees should know, it has multiple mistakes and could be written better.

I decided to do so and this is the result.

## Building
```sh
make matrix-matrix.pdf
```
